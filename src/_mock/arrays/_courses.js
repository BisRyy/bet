<h3> Holiness </h3>

<p> We can divide Holiness in to two:</p>
<ul>
<li> Natural Holiness </li>
<li> Gifted Holiness </li>
</ul>   

<hr>

<p> Natural Holiness is Holiness that belongs only to God. Gifted Holiness is Holiness that given for heavenly Angeles and earthly humans by God, when they found proper for this honor. Specials humans became Holy when they serve God with a stable faith, good deed, and sincerity. Because in the Bible it said, .<strong> “you shall be holy, for I your God am Holy” </strong>  (Lev.19:2)</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>ማን ነው የሚለየን ጌታ ካንተ ፍቅር <br />
መከራና ስቃይ ረሃብ ወይስ ችግር <br />
ሰይፍ ቢዘረጋ ጎራዴ ቢወደር <br />
ባንችል በምድር ላይ እንደ ሰው መኖር <br />
የለም የሚለየን ጌታ ካንተ ፍቅር &nbsp;</blockquote>

<p>Considering their accomplishment in spiritual activities, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church gave the honor of Holiness for many foreign and native personalities. In addition the Church made them to be remembered by building a church, founding a monastery, and engraving a tablet [of law] in their name. Since it is difficult to discuss the biography and activity of all foreign and local saints with such short article, we shall discus only the selected ones.<br /> </p>
